# Effective-Goal-Setting

The goal of this application will be to help users set effective goals. The app will do so by providing an intuitive UI that will walk the user through some "goal-setting criteria." After having goals set the app will help the user set a start/end time and will allow them to specify how much time they want to set asside each week to work towards this goal. This apps intention is to be a self-improvement app that will help the user set short term goals for things such as personal projects or hobbys.
